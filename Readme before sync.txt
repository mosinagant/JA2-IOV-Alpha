This mod for Ja2 is originally created and maintained by Chinese fans Dboy and Zwwooooo etc., it contains a large amount of realistic weapons&ammos&attchs and other features that are already integrated into 1.13 sourcefiles.

Due to the lack of Ja2 coders in China and the rapid dev of 1.13 mods, now it is allocated here for international modders to adjust.

Please PM Zwwooooo or John_5696 in BearsPit? if you want to join this project.


This is Zwwooooo's pure 2013-07-29 build, it is NOT compatible with the latest 1.13 build currently, only for modders to test.
