Adapt IOV to JA2-1.13 Project

Project's detailed plan:

Original plan was cancelled, because current IOV v929 does not need such a big change, it works fine on the latest 1.13 exe, except for minor but could be mass bugs (See history for details.)

929 bug list:
1. MercStartingGear has missing Weapons for some A.I.M., reason unknown, such weapons can be bought from BR normally and behave normal in game.
2. Certain attachment value maybe missing when attach to a weapon, not always, they sometimes appear and sometimes don't. Reason unknown.
